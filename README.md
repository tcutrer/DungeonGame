# GUILDED HOLLOW
This game is a classic dungeon builder with a modern twist,
instead of going through a dungeon, you are making it!
You are the witch or wizard building a sprawling dungeon and fighting hordes
of greedy adventures.

Summon and command monsters, build sprawling castles, control your fate, 
all these and more in GUILDED HOLLOW!

MAIN FEAUTURES:
FIEND SYSTEM:
Each time you start a new game adventures will be randomly generated, if they survive each round, they will come back bigger and stronger creating a new story every game!

COMMAND SYSTEM:
Command your monsters by unlocking new witchy commands such as attack or strafe. The further you make it, the more resources you will have to unlock new commands, spells, monsters, and materials!
